Backend -
1. create a folder called backend
2. cd backend
3. npm init -y (this is so you create a package.json file inside backend directory)
4. now install a few dependencies, npm install express cors mongodb dotenv
    express - What we use for the web server
    cors - cross origin resource sharing, this will help make the right connections without errors
    mongodb - so you can interact with the database
    dotenv - loads environmental variables from a .env file
5. npm install -g nodemon
    nodemon - helps restart the node application without restarting the server whenever files are changed

Start server: Inside the backend directory, run "nodemon server"
