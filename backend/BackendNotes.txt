Quick Tips:
Start server: Inside the backend directory, run "nodemon server"

Backend -
1. create a folder called backend

2. cd backend

3. npm init -y (this is so you create a package.json file inside backend directory)

4. now install a few dependencies, npm install express cors mongodb dotenv
    express - What we use for the web server
    cors - cross origin resource sharing, this will help make the right connections without errors
    mongodb - so you can interact with the database
    dotenv - loads environmental variables from a .env file

5. npm install -g nodemon
    nodemon - helps restart the node application without restarting the server whenever files are changed

6. Go into the package.json file and add "type": "module" (this will allow us to use the import statements from es6)

7. create a file server.js

8. create a .env file, need to find the URI, which can be found in the mongodb, connect, connect your application, copy the URI.

9. create a file index.js (this file will connect to the database and start the server)

10. create a new folder called api

11. inside the api folder, create restaurants.route.js

12. now test the backend server, go to the backend directory in your terminal, type "nodemon server" 
(use a demonstration route -> router.route("/").get((req, res) => res.send("hello world")); //demonstration route)

13. In your web browser, go to http://localhost:5000/api/v1/restaurants -> the 5000 is the port in your .env file

Go to your google keeps, go to the video, left off at 24.39. You're about to create the dao folder.
